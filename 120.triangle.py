#
# Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you
# may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
# 
# For example, given the following triangle
# 
# 
# [
# ⁠    [2],
# ⁠   [3,4],
# ⁠  [6,5,7],
# ⁠ [4,1,8,3]
# ]
# 
# 
# The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
# 
# Note:
# 
# Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n
# is the total number of rows in the triangle.

class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not triangle:
            return 
        res = triangle[-1]
        for i in range(len(triangle)-2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(len(triangle[i])):
                res[j] = min(res[j], res[j+1]) + triangle[i][j]
        return res[0]
