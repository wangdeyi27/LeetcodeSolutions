#
# Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
# 
# Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.Â 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 10
# Output: 12
# Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10
# ugly numbers.
# 
# Note: Â 
# 
# 
# 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
# n does not exceed 1690.

class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        ugly = [1]
        i2 = i3 = i5 = 0
        while len(ugly) < n:
            u2, u3, u5 = 2 * ugly[i2], 3 * ugly[i3], 5 * ugly[i5]
            umin = min((u2, u3, u5))
            if u2 == umin: i2 += 1
            if u3 == umin: i3 += 1
            if u5 == umin: i5 += 1
            ugly.append(umin)
        return ugly[-1]
