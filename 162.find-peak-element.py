#
# A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
# 
# Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and
# return its index.
# 
# The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any
# one of the peaks is fine.
# 
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
# number 2.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 1 or 5 
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
# element is 2, 
# or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = [float('-inf')] + nums + [float('-inf')]
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
                return mid-1
            elif nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
