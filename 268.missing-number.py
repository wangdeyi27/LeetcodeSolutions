# Testcase Example:  '[3,0,1]'
#
# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find
# the one that is missing from the array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,0,1]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8
# 
# 
# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it using only constant extra space complexity?

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        return (1 + n) * n // 2 - sum(nums)
