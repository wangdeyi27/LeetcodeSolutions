# Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of
# S which equals T.
# 
# A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original
# string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing
# the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a
# subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# 
# As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
# (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
