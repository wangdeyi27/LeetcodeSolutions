# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[6,9]]\n[2,5]'
#
# Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the
# intervals (merge if necessary).
# 
# You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their
# start times.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
# Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
# Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
# Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with
# [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
