# Testcase Example:  '[100,4,200,1,3,2]'
#
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
# consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
# Therefore its length is 4.

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        nums = set(nums)

        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 not in nums:
                tmp = num
                cur = 1
                while tmp + 1 in nums:
                    tmp += 1
                    cur += 1
                res = cur if cur > res else res
        return res
